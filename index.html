            <p>A team of designers, finance consultants, and coders</p>
            <p>Aim is to find hidden water sources using nasa data and AI/ML</p>
            <p>Create a global water map/App</p>

            <h2>Why is it important</h2>
            <p style="color:black">85% of the world population lives in the driest half of the planet</p>
            <p>Droughts are 5% of natural disasters but account for 25% of people effected by natural disasters</p>
            <p>783 million do not have access to clean water</p>
            <p>We can find other planets can we find water closer to home</p>

            <p>Build a Data cube and Create a Global AI Challenge</p>
            <p>We Also Tested Some Hypothoses</p>

            <p>Latitude, Longitude, Time</p>
	    <p>+</p>
	    <p>Temperature, Vapor, Gravity, Radiation PLUS PUBLIC DATA (Bore Hole)</p>
            <p>Query in imaginitive ways</p>

            <p>Who has the world's smartest AI? </p>
            <p>Challenge the big players to stop playing games- solve problems instead</p>
            <p>Put the data cube in the cloud for people to play with</p>

            <h2>What we tested</h2>
            <p>Does the surface temprature change with sub surface water?</p>
            <p>Short version: Not with the data we can get</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficult to detect a few feet in the ground</li>
              <li>Resolution too low. 1km Squares</li>
              <li>Sparse existing water monitoring points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Maybe when combined with other sources in the cube</p>

            <p>Does the plant growth change with sub surface water?</p>
            <p>Short version: Can't tell</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Monitoring points are not where plants are</li>
              <li>Too low resolution</li>
