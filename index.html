            <ul>
              <li>Solve the worlds water problems by helping people find the water around them</li>
              <li>A team of designers, finance consultants, and coders</li>
              <li>Vision to create a for purpose foundation (Non profit foundation)</li>

            <p>We want to solve the world’s water problem by helping people such as farmers, refugees in water depleted areas  to find water around them.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>We are a team of coders, designers, finance consultants with a vision to create a “For Purpose foundation” (Non Profit Foundation) that uses open source NASA data to allow people to find water around them no matter who or where they are.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Our vision is to solve first world and third world water problems. By using our app we allow a refugee to go to a location which would allow them to dig for water near their camp. The app using the DATA from NASA would make this easy to use and accessible. And we could help a farmer in either the developed world or developing world with the same issue</p>

          <h2>Why is it important</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>85% of the world population lives in the driest half of the planet.</li>
            <li>783 million people do not have access to clean water</li>
            <li>Almost 2.5 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Multi dimentional table of data</p>
            <p>2 Spatial dimentions, Time, data sources</p>
            <p>A really big job but we have a plan</p>

            <h2>What we tested</h2>
            <p>Does the surface temprature change with sub surface water?</p>
            <p>Short version: Nope</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficult to detect a few feet in the ground</li>
              <li>Resolution too low. 1km Squares</li>
              <li>Sparse existing water monitoring points</li>
              <li>Monitoring points are also not corolated with plant growth</li>
